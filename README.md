üìå We'll implement an end-to-end chatbot with the following structure:

- User Input (Text/Voice) 
        
- NLP Engine (Preprocessing: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Vectorization)
        
- Intent Classifier (Deep Learning Model - TensorFlow)
        
- Response Generator (Predefined responses or AI-generated)
        
- Memory Management (Context Handling & Session Tracking)
        
- Multi-Channel Deployment (Web App, Telegram, WhatsApp, API)
